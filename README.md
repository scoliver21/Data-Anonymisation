# 📁 Data Anonymisation Project

**A beginner-friendly data anonymisation project using Python, pandas, and Faker.**

This project simulates a real-world data privacy task based on the [Commonwealth Bank Virtual Experience on Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The dataset used is entirely fictional and strictly for educational purposes.

- **Column removal**
- **Data masking**
- **Synthetic data generation**
- **Hashing (tokenisation)**
- **Date perturbation**
- **Binning (bucketing)**
